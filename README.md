## CRUD Maqalat
Maqalat is a completely functional CRUD API the features can be tested. Setting it up will create 30 Fake Articles with an `id`, `title` and `body` along with an `author_url` currently set to *[https://imtiazraqib.com](https://imtiazraqib.com)*

#### Setup Maqalat for testing
1. Download [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
2. Clone the repository
3. Open XAMPP Control Center and start the Apache Server
4. Fire up a browser and type in `http://maqalat.test` and it is working if you see the **Laravel** logo
5. Fire up [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) or your choice of API tester (Although Postman is pretty cool, not sponsored! ðŸ˜¢)

6. Below is the workflow for [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/):
    - **[POST]()**  -> http://maqalat.test/api/article
        - Add a new Header with **Key** = [Content-Type]() and **Value** = [application/json]()
        - Body follows a `raw` format as shown below
        ```json
            {
                "title":"Whatever is your new title",
                "body":"Whatever you wanna keep as the new body"
            }
        ```
    - **[GET]()**   -> http://maqalat.test/api/articles
    - **[PUT]()**   -> http://maqalat.test/api/article
        - Add a new Header with **Key** = [Content-Type]() and **Value** = [application/json]()
        - Body follows a `raw` format as shown below
        ```json
            {
                "article_id": 4,
                "title":"Whatever is your UPDATED title",
                "body":"Whatever you wanna keep as the UPDATED body"
            }
        ```
        - The `article_id` is the `id` of the article that you want to update with the following `title` and `body`
    - **[DEL]()**   -> http://maqalat.test/api/article/{id}
        - Replace `{id}` with the actual article id you want to delete.

## Inspiration
The project is setup personally for me to learn Laravel and familiarize myself with the framework. The project would not have been possible without the tutorial from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) over at YouTube. His video titled, *[Laravel 5.5 API From Scratch Using Resources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pc6cgisbKE)* is what I used personally to follow along and learn the fundamentals of Laravel.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
